    r"""
    Solve a Schrödinger equation using the Euler method.

    Integrates the Schrödinger equation in real or imaginary time using
    a first order Euler method. The equation is defined as
    .. math::
        i\frac{d}{dt}\psi = H(t) \psi
    in real time and as
    .. math::
        \frac{d}{dt}\psi = -H(t) \psi
    in imaginary time evolution.

    The integration algorithm is very simple. It is
    .. math::
        \psi(t_{n+1}) = \psi(t_{n}) - i \delta t H \psi(t_{n})
    for real time and
    .. math::
        \psi(t_{n+1}) = \psi(t_{n}) - \delta t H \psi(t_{n})
    for imaginary time evolution. The integration step is deduced from
    the arguments as explained below.

    The `t_span` denotes the integration interval.
    * If it is a single number `T`, the initial condition is ..math::`t=0`
      the evolution proceeds in steps of :math:`\delta{t}=T/N`
      where `N=steps`.
    * If `t_span` is a tuple, it contains the initial and final time,
      and the number of integration steps is deduced from `N=steps`
      as :math:`\delta{t}=T/N`
    * If `t_span` is a sequence of numbers, starting with the initial
      condition, and progressing in time steps `t_span[n+1]-t_span[n]`.

    The Euler algorithm is a very bad integrator and is offered only for
    illustrative purposes.
